REQUIREMENTS

Keychain requires bash 2.0 or greater to run, and expects "/bin/bash" to be a
bash 2.0+ shell; if this isn't the case, you will need to change the first line
of keychain from "#!/bin/bash" to something like "#!/bin/bash2" so that
keychain will run under bash 2.0+.  This fix is needed for RedHat 6.2, and
possibly other popular Linux distributions.

INSTALLATION

To install keychain, simply use the "install" command as follows:

install -m0755 keychain /usr/bin/keychain

Keychain is now installed.  Now, type "keychain --help | less -R" for
instructions on how to use keychain.  You'll find intructions for modifying
your ~/.bash_profile under the "Description" section.  For more detailed
information on keychain, be sure to visit the Gentoo Linux keychain project
