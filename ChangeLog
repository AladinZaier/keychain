*keychain 1.0.1; fixes for calling "pidof"; README; ChangeLog

  07 Sep 2001;
  Addition of README stating that keychain requires bash 2.0 or greater,
  as well as quick install directions and web URL.

  07 Sep 2001;
  Explicitly added /sbin and /usr/sbin to path, and then called "pidof".
  I think that this is a bit more robust.
  
  06 Sep 2001; from John Ellson <ellson@lucent.com>: 
  "pidof" changed to "/sbin/pidof", since it's probably not in $PATH
 
  06 Sep 2001;
  New ChangeLog! :)

*keychain 1.0; initial release (Aug 2001)
