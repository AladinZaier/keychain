RELEASE NOTES:

KeyChain 1.3 and above now create ~/.ssh-agent-[hostname] files, making
KeyChain compatible with NFS-mounted home directories.  There is also a new
~/.ssh-agent-csh-[hostname] available that can be sourced by csh-based shells.


REQUIREMENTS

KeyChain 1.3 and above should now be sh-compliant and work with any bash 1,
bash 2, ksh and zsh-compatible shell.  Colorization features may look weird if
you're not using a vt100-compatible terminal and can be disabled with the
--nocolor option.

INSTALLATION

To install keychain, simply use the "install" command as follows:

install -m0755 keychain /usr/bin/keychain

Keychain is now installed.  Now, type "keychain --help | less -R" for
instructions on how to use keychain.  You'll find intructions for modifying
your ~/.bash_profile under the "Description" section.  For more detailed
information on keychain, be sure to visit the Gentoo Linux keychain project
