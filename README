REQUIREMENTS

Keychain 1.2 and above should work with any sh-compatible shell, and should
work under most POSIX-friendly environments.  Colorization features may look
weird if you're not using a vt100-compatible terminal; There will be a fix
for this in the next keychain release.

INSTALLATION

To install keychain, simply use the "install" command as follows:

install -m0755 keychain /usr/bin/keychain

Keychain is now installed.  Now, type "keychain --help | less -R" for
instructions on how to use keychain.  You'll find intructions for modifying
your ~/.bash_profile under the "Description" section.  For more detailed
information on keychain, be sure to visit the Gentoo Linux keychain project
