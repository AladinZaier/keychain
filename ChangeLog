  Add /usr/ucb to path for Solaris systems.
  
  11 Oct 2001; Idea from Joe Reid (jreid@vnet.net):
  Try to add multiple keys using ssh-add; avoid typing in identical
  passphrases more than once.  Good idea!

*keychain 1.5 (21 Sep 2001)

  21 Sep 2001; David Hull (hull@paracel.com):
  misc. compatibility, signal handling, cleanup fixes
  
  21 Sep 2001; 
  "ps" test to find the right one for your OS.

  20 Sep 2001; Marko Myllynen (myllynen@lut.fi):
  "grep [s]sh-agent" to "grep [s]sh-agent" (zsh fix)

*keychain 1.4 (20 Sep 2001)

  20 Sep 2001; David Hull (hull@paracel.com):
  "touch $foo" to ">$foo" optimization and other "don't fork" fixes.
  Converted ${foo#--} to a case statement for Solaris sh compatibility.

  20 Sep 2001;
  Try an alternate "ps" syntax if our default one fails.  This should
  give us Solaris and IRIX (sysV) compatibility without breaking BSD.

  20 Sep 2001; Hans Peter Verne (h.p.verne@usit.uio.no);
  "echo -e" to "echo $E" (for IRIX compatibility with --nocolor),
  optimization of grep ("grep [s]sh-agent")
  
  17 Sep 2001; Marko Myllynen (myllynen@lut.fi):
  Various fixes: trap signal 2 if signal INT not supported (NetBSD);
  handle invalid keys correctly; ancient version of ash didn't support ~,
  so using $HOME; correct zsh instruction; minor cleanups

*keychain 1.3 (12 Sep 2001)
  
  12 Sep 2001;
  Minor color changes; the cyan was hard to read on xterm-colored
  terms so it was switched to bold.  Additional --help text added.
  
  10 Sep 2001;
  We now use .ssh-agent-[hostname] instead of .ssh-agent.
  We now create a .ssh-agent-csh-[hostname] file that can be sourced
  by csh-compatible shells.  We also now kill all our existing 
  ssh-agent processes before starting a new one.

  10 Sep 2001; Robert R. Wal (rrw@hell.pl):
  Very nice NFS fixes, colorization fixes, tcsh redirect -> grep -v
  fix.  Thanks go out to others who sent me similar patches.

  10 Sep 2001; Johann Visagie (johann@egenetics.com):
  "source" to "." shell-compatibility fixes.  Thanks for the FreeBSD
  port.

  10 Sep 2001; Marko Myllynen (myllynen@lut.fi):
  rm -f $pidf after stopping ssh-agent fix

*keychain 1.2 

  09 Sep 2001; README updates to reflect new changes.
  
  09 Sep 2001; Marko Myllynen (myllynen@lut.fi):
  bash 1/zsh/sh compatibility; now only tries to kill *your*
  ssh-agent processes, version fix, .ssh-agent file creation error 
  detection.  Thanks! 

*keychain 1.1; fixes for calling "pidof"; README; ChangeLog

  07 Sep 2001;
  Addition of README stating that keychain requires bash 2.0 or greater,
  as well as quick install directions and web URL.

  07 Sep 2001;
  Explicitly added /sbin and /usr/sbin to path, and then called "pidof".
  I think that this is a bit more robust.
  
  06 Sep 2001; from John Ellson (ellson@lucent.com): 
  "pidof" changed to "/sbin/pidof", since it's probably not in $PATH
 
  06 Sep 2001;
  New ChangeLog! :)

*keychain 1.0; initial release (Aug 2001)
