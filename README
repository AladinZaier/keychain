REQUIREMENTS

Keychain should run on any Bourne shell.  Colorization features may look weird
if you're not using a vt100-compatible terminal and can be disabled with the
--nocolor option.  You can make keychain less verbose by using the -q or --quiet
option.

INSTALLATION

To install keychain, simply use the "install" command as follows:

install -m0755 keychain /usr/bin/keychain

Keychain is now installed.  Now, look at keychain.txt or the manual
page (they are the same) for instructions on how to use keychain.  For
additional information on keychain, be sure to visit the Gentoo Linux
keychain project page at:
